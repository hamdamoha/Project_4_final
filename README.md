Methodology (to be re-written)
=======
## <a id="Methodology-header"></a><ins>Methodology</ins>
>>>>>>> main

Establish a baseline method using logistic regression
Use 3 - 4 other methods to compare accuracy for this data set.
Show visualisations of individual methods and comparison between techniques.
Summarise and conclude
