The aim of the project was to utilise a number of Machine Learning techniques on a medical dataset to determine which techniques are most successful in terms of model accuracy. The dataset chosen was that of a survey of Native American Prima Indian females. 



## <a id="Methodology-header"></a><ins>Methodology</ins>


* Establish a baseline method using logistic regression
* Use 3 - 4 other methods to compare accuracy for this data set.
* Show visualisations of individual methods and comparison between techniques.
* Summarise and conclude
