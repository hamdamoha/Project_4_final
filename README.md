## <a id="Goal-header"></a><ins>Introduction</ins>

The aim of the project was to utilise a number of Machine Learning techniques on a medical dataset to determine which techniques are most successful in terms of model accuracy. The dataset chosen was that of a survey of Native American Prima Indian females. 


## <a id="Goal-header"></a><ins>Methodology</ins>

Establish a baseline method using logistic regression
Use 3 - 4 other methods to compare accuracy for this data set.
Show visualisations of individual methods and comparison between techniques.
Summarise and conclude
