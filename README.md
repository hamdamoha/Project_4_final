The aim of the project was to utilise a number of Machine Learning techniques on a medical dataset to determine which techniques are most successful in terms of model accuracy. The dataset chosen was that of a survey of Native American Prima Indian females.

Recognising the timesclae and finite resources at our disposal, a project timing plan was produced to ensure the team remained focussed and co-ordinated to meet the requirements of the project and the presentation date.

* Interrogate and understand the dataset
* Show visualisations to highlight understanding of the characteristics of the dataset
* Establish a "baseline method" using logistic regression
* Use other Machine Learning techniques to compare accuracy for this data set.
* Record results of individual methods and then compare all techniques investigated.
* Summarise and conclude

In addition to the resource and timing issues mentioned above, the biggest challenge the team encountered was understanding the data as received. The decision was made to maximise our understanding of the nature of the data before proceeding with the machine learning techniques to be applied. In this way it was felt that we would provide a more validated result set with associated conclusions.

The data itself contained a significant numbers of zeros that were possible present in place of no readings. However the challenge was to determine if there were some values that were indeed numerically equal to zero. In order to mitigate the risk it was decided to incorporate the two conditions in our analysis of the data and to evaluate modelling performance on two datasets containg zeroes and with zeroes removed.
