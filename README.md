The aim of the project was to utilise a number of Machine Learning techniques on a medical dataset to determine which techniques are most successful in terms of model accuracy. The dataset chosen was that of a survey of Native American Prima Indian females. 


##  Resource Management


Recognising the timesclae and finite resources at our disposal, a project timing plan was produced to ensure the team remained focussed and co-ordinated to meet the requirements of the project and the presentation date. 



## <a id="Methodology-header"></a><ins>Methodology</ins>


* Interrogate and understand the dataset
* Show visualisations to highlight understanding of the characteristics of the dataset
* Establish a baseline method using logistic regression
* Use other Machine Learning techniques to compare accuracy for this data set.
* Record results of individual methods and then compare all techniques investigated.
* Summarise and conclude
