## A Comparison of Machine Learning Methods on a Medical Dataset: Predicting Diabetes 

Introduction 
The aim of the project was to utilise a number of Machine Learning techniques on a medical dataset to determine which techniques are most successful in terms of model accuracy. The dataset chosen was that of a survey of Native American Prima Indian females. 


Methodology (to be re-written)
Establish a baseline method using logistic regression
Use 3 - 4 other methods to compare accuracy for this data set.
Show visualisations of individual methods and comparison between techniques.
Summarise and conclude
